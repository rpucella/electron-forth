# Electron Forth

A simple exercise in building an Electron app - a baby forth interpreter. 

Example:

    . : test + *
    TEST
    . 10 20 30 test
    500
    


## To build

You can run the code directly via electron using

    yarn start
    
You can build a standalone app with electron-builder using

    yarn build
    
It will build an app for your OS/architecture.
